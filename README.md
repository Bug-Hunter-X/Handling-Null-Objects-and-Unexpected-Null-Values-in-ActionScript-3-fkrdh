This repository demonstrates two common and uncommon issues related to null pointer exceptions and unexpected null values when working with ActionScript 3.  The first example shows a straightforward null pointer exception that occurs when accessing a property of a null object. The second showcases a more subtle error where default property values in a custom class might not behave as expected when null values are unexpectedly passed during object construction.  Solutions are provided to address both scenarios, emphasizing the importance of robust null checks and defensive programming practices in ActionScript 3 development.
